      This app can be used to simply play a tic tac toe game for now, but it
      can be modified to make use of the board as a keypad. Try to place
      digits 1-9 in the squares and create a scenario where a certain sequence
      is needed to unlock some special feature. Doing so may prove worthy of
      your time and effort. Be sure to check out a dev branch on your local
      machine before attempting this as a developer... you cant push to master
      any way if you cloned the repo where Brad had stored this on his
      GitHub...

    <p>
      During a surprise nuclear attack drill, many United States Air Force
      Strategic Missile Wing controllers prove unwilling to turn the keys
      required to launch a missile strike. Such refusals convince John
      McKittrick and other NORAD systems engineers that missile launch control
      centers must be automated, without human intervention. Control is given
      to a NORAD supercomputer known as WOPR (War Operation Plan Response,
      pronounced "whopper"), programmed to continuously run war simulations
      and learn over time.
